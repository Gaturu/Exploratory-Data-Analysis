Itâ€™s a classic dataset to explore and expand your feature engineering skills and day to day understanding from multiple shopping experiences. This is a regression problem. The dataset has 550,068 rows and 12 columns.

The objective is to try and understand the customer in order to predict the Purchase Amount

We shall use the dataset to Learn Exploratory Data Analysis and finally create a Linear regression model, fit and train it using the datset.
